# Fictional Casino - Bet dos Amigos

## Description
This project was developed for the Systems Development Technologies course. It is a fictional website (frontend only) of a fake casino, created to demonstrate knowledge in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. JavaScript was used to simulate a registration process, storing data in the browser's Local Storage.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Content structuring.  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout design.  
- **Bootstrap** – Creation of responsive components and faster development.  
- **JavaScript** – Simulated registration with data storage in Local Storage.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```
3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your browser to view the homepage.

## Notes
- The project is frontend-only and has no backend integration.  
- A video used on the site is not available because its size exceeds GitHub's upload limit. If any error occurs, it's likely due to the missing `cr7edit.mp4` file in the `img` folder.
